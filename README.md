# Food and Outfit Picker - indecisive.io
Steve Jobs wore the same outfit everyday. 
Why? Because he wanted to eliminate the amount of decisions he makes in a day in order to eliminate decision fatigue, so that he can have more energy to work on engineering and business.
However, wearing the same thing isn't acceptable for everyone.

Here comes our project: **indecisive.io**

With just a click of a few buttons, **our app randomly selects the user's outfit for the day, and the food that they will be eating!**
This allows our users to make less decisions and at the same time, not have to wear/eat the same thing every day.
