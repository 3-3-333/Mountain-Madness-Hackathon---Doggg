# Food and Outfit Picker - indecisive.io
Steve Jobs wore the same outfit everyday. 
Why? Because he wanted to reduce the amount of decisions he makes in a day in order to reduce decision fatigue, so that he can have more energy to work on engineering and business.
Most people would like to have more energy, but they are not willing to wear the same thing every day.

Here comes our project: **indecisive.io**

With a click of a few buttons, **our app randomly selects the user's outfit and food for the day!**
This allows our users to make less decisions and at the same time, have something different to wear/eat every day.
